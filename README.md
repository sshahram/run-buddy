# Run Buddy Website

## Introduction

This project is about creating a website for a fitness company called Run Buddy. In this website, I have designed two pages:
* The Main Page for the website and
* The Privacy Policy Page

### My Motivation

The main reason behind creating this website is to practice some HTML and CSS Styles.

### Screenshot

The following images show the mock-up provided by Run Buddy Team:
